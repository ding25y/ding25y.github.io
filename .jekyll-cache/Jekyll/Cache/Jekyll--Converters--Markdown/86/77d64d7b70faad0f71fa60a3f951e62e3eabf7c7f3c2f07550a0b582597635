I"¢<p>I am watching <em>How do you know</em>, starring Reese Witherspooon and Paul Rudd. Itâ€™s kind of making me redefining how relationhsips should be. How life, decisions, self-consciousness, knowing-who-you-really-are-instead-of-being-told-who-you-should-be. I just love her character, Lisa.</p>

<p>Know yourself, Understand your own thoughts, seek for (and harder, identify)what you want. My lifelong subjects.</p>
