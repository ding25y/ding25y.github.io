 I am watching *How do you know*, starring Reese Witherspooon and Paul Rudd. It's kind of making me redefining how relationhsips should be. How life, decisions, self-consciousness, knowing-who-you-really-are-instead-of-being-told-who-you-should-be. I just love her character, Lisa.

 Know yourself, Understand your own thoughts, seek for (and harder, identify)what you want. My lifelong subjects.
